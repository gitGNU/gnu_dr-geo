Dr. Geo an OFSET development
===============================

**********************************************************************

 REPORTING BUGS							

	Because Dr Geo is developped as a free software, it needs
	you, users to report bugs.
	If you find a bug do not hesitate to report it to
	<ofset-drgenius-dev@lists.sourceforge.net>, if you can also 
	send a file showing the bug in action, it's even better.
		
**********************************************************************


Dr. Geo was at the beginning a merge of the genius calculator and
Dr. Geo, an interactive geometry software. In fact all the geometry
software has been rewritten, in the mean time the maintainer lose
interest in the development of the genius calculator.  So instead of
keeping unmaintained code which I can't maintain I decided to remove
the calculator and I replace it with a scheme interpretor.

CVS ACCESS
==========

To get the newest Dr. Geo source from the CVS, you need to have cvs
installed, next you need to setup a few environmental variables.

The first command you need is:
export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'
You might want to put this in your login script. 

Then do the command:
cvs login
(there is no password, just hit return)

cvs -z3 checkout drgeo


To compile from the CVS you need to do the following:

aclocal
autoheader
automake -a
libtoolize -f
intltoolize 
autoconf
autoheader
./configure --prefix=/usr
make


Then for additional compilation, only the last step has to be done.
Eventually when updating the CVS module you may need to restart all the
steps.


TAGS FOR EMACS
==============


You can build a list of tags to be used under Emacs with the following
commands:

etags --members *.c *.cc *.h geo/*.cc geo/*.h
