QUICK TODO LIST
===============

	- Dans la section Guile Script ajouter un exemple décrivant
plus simplement la fonctionnalité
	- Ajouter une bibliographie sur Scheme


TASK LIST 
=========

(no priority order)
-------------------

. Ajouter un menu dans la barre de menu de la liste des fenêtres

. Ajouter un menu dans la barre de menu de la liste des macros

. Design a exporter to OpenOffice.org Draw, should be easy for any one
knowing the OpenOffice.org Draw format.

. Port to Windows32 and MacOSX. This should be quite easy as Dr.Geo
only depends on GTK+2, LibGlade2, LibXml2 and LibGuile. Any help to do
that would be appreciated.

. Move all the icones under the 'others' menu icon in the
toolbar. Then remove the 'others' icon from the toolbar

. Make Dr.Genius TeXmacs aware so that DrGenius can send directly to
TeXmacs an .eps output of an opened figure.

. Display the name of the circle and line object along the object in
the figure area.
-in progresse, done for line-

. Write a documentation.
-in progress-

. Implement a virtual getDescription method for the geometricObject
class, cleaner way!!!

. Add a script feature of the figure. The script is a human readable
description of a figure construction.
-done-

. Add a polygon feature, with filled option. The polygon will not be
an object as the other, it can be used to emphasis region on a figure.
-done-

. Make the UNDO/REDO mechanism to work with the macro-construction.

. Make the macro-construction be nice with the descriptive view of a
figure: plot the imput element and the resulting element.

. Fix the annoying that says can't save figure even when the figure is
saved.
-done-

. Implemeting Guile scriptability for menus, buttons and geometric
figure. Typically guile script will be embedded in the xml file format
so new menus and new buttons could be defined for a specific
figure. Button with guile callback will be placed in a dedicated place
holder. Default icons buttons may also be hidden using guile commands.

. Improve locus sampling
-In progress-

. Defining a DrGeo API to be used for guile scriptability.
-Done-

. Implementing a guile based console, so user can play interactively
from the console with a geometric figure.

. Implement a geometry property checker. Can be based on Guile or even
on CLIPS a 1st generation expert system
(http://www.ghg.net/clips/CLIPS.html).

. CORBA use for distance control over a figure: tutoring with
Dr. Genius. A tutor and a learner can interact on the same figure but
from different geographic location.

. Redesign the icon of the locus button.

. Design a new icon for the property function, now only available from
the popup menu.
-done-

. Add a script feature of the figure. The script is a human readable
description of a figure construction.
